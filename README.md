> This webpage now has a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.

## General Information
This webpage meets accessibility standards.  When one views the source code, there are semantic HTML elements (div changed to section, main, aside, etc.)  One will find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.  The image and icon elements now have accessible alt attributes and everything is in sequential order.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Links function correctly.
- Comments in the CSS stylesheet.
- HTML and CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized.


## Screenshots

<!-- If you have screenshots you'd like to share, include them here. -->


## Setup
HTML is organized with semantic elements by using header, section, main, aside. and footer.  CSS has been organized and consolidated into specific classes in order to avoid redundancy and save codespace.


## Usage
The links in the nav bar located on the top right of the webpage will jump down to that section of the page. Alt attributes have been added so people with disabilities have web accessibility.  Screen readers can read the description of images for people with visual disabilities.
